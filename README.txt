Do not modify the following:

.hg
basefiles


*****

If desktop.ini is the only file that has been changed, do not worry about committing.

If committing and files have been removed, make sure sourcetree knows that they have been removed (not grey, but red). If necessary, make a special, seperate commit to remove files.

Do not move the Utilities folder. That is the universal folder for all non-FRC LabVIEW files. (Original Code)
